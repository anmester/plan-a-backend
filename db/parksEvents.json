Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance.

All children must be accompanied by a caregiver at all times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Imagination Playground <\/strong><br \/>\nImagination Playground was designed by famed architect David Rockwell and is an interactive, transformable space that prompts children to manipulate their environment and create a play space of their own. With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br \/>\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-10","enddate":"2019-09-10","starttime":"2:00 pm","endtime":"4:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"Kids and Families Le Petit Art","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/10\/kids-and-families-le-petit-art","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/10\/kids-and-families-le-petit-art","description":"<p>Date: September 10, 2019<\/p><p><p>Have fun creating tiny art to take home or give as a gift.

The role of the Playground Associate is to serve as a catalyst to foster your child&rsquo;s creativity and fun, helping them to then explore the Imagination Playground and play on their own! All children must be accompanied by a caregiver at all times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Imagination Playground <\/strong><br \/>\nImagination Playground was designed by famed architect David Rockwell and is an interactive, transformable space that prompts children to manipulate their environment and create a play space of their own. With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br \/>\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-12","enddate":"2019-09-12","starttime":"2:00 pm","endtime":"4:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"The River Project Wetlab Look-ins","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/12\/the-river-project-wetlab-lookins","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/12\/the-river-project-wetlab-lookins","description":"<p>Date: September 12, 2019<\/p><p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.riverprojectnyc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">THE RIVER PROJECT<\/a> WETLAB LOOK-INS<\/p>\n\n<p>Tuesdays & Thursdays<br \/>\nNow through Nov. 5<br \/>\n2:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM<br \/>\nPier 40 Wetlab at W.

All children must be accompanied by a caregiver at all times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Imagination Playground <\/strong><br \/>\nImagination Playground was designed by famed architect David Rockwell and is an interactive, transformable space that prompts children to manipulate their environment and create a play space of their own. With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br \/>\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-14","enddate":"2019-09-14","starttime":"10:00 am","endtime":"4:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"Think Tank - Bug Party!","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/14\/think-tank-bug-party","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/14\/think-tank-bug-party","description":"<p>Date: September 14, 2019<\/p><p><p>Come learn to engineer wings, like those birds and bugs use for flight.

Prospect Park Alliance and Turnstile Tours host a series of themed walking tours that examine the many layers of natural and human history to be found in Brooklyn&#39;s Backyard. Tours begin at the Brooklyn Public Library at Grand Army Plaza.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Hidden Treasures Tour (1st Sundays):<\/strong> Explore some of the little-known corners of Prospect Park in this tour that uncovers some of the park&rsquo;s hidden treasures. Once prime attractions, these areas are currently the focus of Prospect Park Alliance restoration efforts to revitalize the park. The tour includes the Rose Garden and Vale of Cashmere in the park&rsquo;s northeast corner, and well as a guided walk through Brooklyn&rsquo;s last remaining forest, the 150-acre Ravine.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Waterways & Wellhouse Tour (2nd Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an engineering marvel, designed around an ingenious drainage system and a chain of manmade streams and ponds that terminate in Brooklyn&rsquo;s largest lake. This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects. This tour will examine some of the fine architectural details and ongoing restoration work, from the era of Vaux and Olmsted to the present day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Brooklyn&rsquo;s Backyard Tour &ndash; includes Zoo and Carousel admission (4th Sundays): <\/strong>Prospect Park is an oasis for people &ndash; and animals! Discover the native habitats and inhabitants of the park, and explore the past and present of recreation, animals, and ongoing conservation efforts of the Prospect Park Alliance. This tour includes an interactive scavenger for children and adults, and ends at the park&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Corner, with a special visit to Prospect Park Zoo and tickets to ride the historic Carousel.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prospectpark.org\/visit-the-park\/things-to-do\/tours\/\">Learn more and get tickets today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:30 am<\/p><p>End time: 12:30 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: Prospect Park<\/p>","parkids":"B073","parknames":"Prospect Park","startdate":"2019-09-15","enddate":"2019-09-15","starttime":"10:30 am","endtime":"12:30 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"Prospect Park","categories":"Art | History | Tours","coordinates":"40.66170120239258000, -73.97080230712890000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5c9a84bce58c9.JPG","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"Nature Exploration Hike: Bugs and Butterflies","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/15\/nature-exploration-hike-bugs-and-butterflies","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/15\/nature-exploration-hike-bugs-and-butterflies","description":"<p>Date: September 15, 2019<\/p><p><p>Our <a href=\"\/programs\/rangers\">Urban Park Ranger<\/a> hiking guides will introduce you to the hidden gems of New York City.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles.

All children must be accompanied by a caregiver at all times.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Imagination Playground <\/strong><br \/>\nImagination Playground was designed by famed architect David Rockwell and is an interactive, transformable space that prompts children to manipulate their environment and create a play space of their own. With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br \/>\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 2:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-19","enddate":"2019-09-19","starttime":"2:00 pm","endtime":"4:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"The River Project Wetlab Look-ins","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/19\/the-river-project-wetlab-lookins","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/19\/the-river-project-wetlab-lookins","description":"<p>Date: September 19, 2019<\/p><p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.riverprojectnyc.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">THE RIVER PROJECT<\/a> WETLAB LOOK-INS<\/p>\n\n<p>Tuesdays & Thursdays<br \/>\nNow through Nov. 5<br \/>\n2:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM<br \/>\nPier 40 Wetlab at W.

With giant foam blocks, children have the potential to build and explore endless possibilities. Imagination Playground addresses a broader spectrum of play needs through opportunities for fantasy and cooperative play, in addition to the traditional running, jumping, and climbing. Kids need to be active on many levels, and they need to exercise their minds as well as their muscles. Research shows that children at the age of eight who have experienced varied and challenging play are considerably better prepared to benefit from ongoing formal education.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Program Dates: <\/strong><br \/>\nTuesday, September 10 - Saturday, October 12<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tuesdays and Thursdays: 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n\t<li>Saturdays: 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/fort-tryon-kids-pop-up-playtime-tickets-71562386023\">Save the date on Eventbrite!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>This program is made possible by the generous support of Con Edison and the Fort Tryon Park Trust.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 10:00 am<\/p><p>End time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: 190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-21","enddate":"2019-09-21","starttime":"10:00 am","endtime":"4:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"190th Street Subway Terrace (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Arts & Crafts | Fitness | Games | Best for Kids","coordinates":"40.85889760259200000, -73.93417525196500000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d71256e84e40.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"Young Chefs - Apple Fritters","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/21\/young-chefs-apple-fritters","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/21\/young-chefs-apple-fritters","description":"<p>Date: September 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>Apple Fritters made with a cakey batter and juicy Granny Smith apples are the ultimate autumn treat!

The performance will occur the afternoon of Saturday, September 21, 2019, close to the autumnal equinox. <\/p>\n\n<p>The work will manifest as 16 performers, mainly from the Uptown community, moving through the park space. The performers will expand and contract together as they pass melodies, passages of text, and the names of loved ones between each other through the park. The work will be in four,  20 minute, iterations with breaks in between. The audience will consist of both those coming directly to see the performance as well as users of the public park space. <\/p>\n\n<p>The audience will be situated within the performers; they will be immersed in the performing elements as they sit or stand on the lawn in the park. The audience will be able to move about freely, to experience the work as they want, with the ability to come and go. The work will be presented in four distinct iterations to allow for the audience to continue to listen to the work or to allow new audience members to arrive as well as giving all performers the opportunity to be the leaders of a performance.<\/p>\n\n<p>The performers themselves will be helping in the creation of the work. Their personal histories will form parts of the materials utilized in the performance. This collaboration will foster a democratizing effect and ideally create a non-hierarchical structure to the work. The performance will be bilingual, in Spanish and English, to better display the polyglot nature of the community. <\/p>\n\n<p>Passages | Pasajes is made possible in part with public funds from Creative Engagement, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and administered by LMCC.<\/p><\/p><p>Start time: 4:00 pm<\/p><p>End time: 6:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: (212) 795-1388<\/p><p>Location: Dongan Lawn (in Fort Tryon Park)<\/p>","parkids":"M029","parknames":"Fort Tryon Park","startdate":"2019-09-21","enddate":"2019-09-21","starttime":"4:00 pm","endtime":"6:00 pm","contact_phone":"(212) 795-1388","location":"Dongan Lawn (in Fort Tryon Park)","categories":"Art | Theater | Free Summer Theater","coordinates":"40.86334745378500000, -73.93090415000900000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/5d41a025214bf.jpg","pubDate":"Sun, 08 Sep 2019 23:59:52 EDT"},{"title":"Summer on the Hudson: Dance Safari","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/21\/summer-on-the-hudson-dance-safari","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2019\/09\/21\/summer-on-the-hudson-dance-safari","description":"<p>Date: September 21, 2019<\/p><p><p>Join our guided walk as we seek out site-specific dances choreographed for Riverside Park South.

This tour will follow the park&rsquo;s scenic watercourse and delve into how Prospect Park Alliance maintains and supports this complex system. The tour will end with a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most unique features of the park: the 1869 Wellhouse, the park&rsquo;s last remaining building by park designer Calvert Vaux, which once housed the machinery that fueled the  watercourse and was recently restored by the Alliance and converted into the first composting restrooms in a NYC park.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Art & Architecture Tour (3rd Sundays): <\/strong>For over 150 years, Prospect Park has been a showcase for beautiful public buildings and artwork, with representations from eras including Beaux-Arts, City Beautiful, the New Deal Modernism, and contemporary LEED-certified projects.
